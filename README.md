<p>Abstract - The success of CNN-based architecture on image classification in learning and extracting features made them so popular these days, but the task of image classification becomes more challenging when we apply state of art models to classify noisy and low-quality images. It is still difficult for models to
extract meaningful features from this type of image due to its low resolution and the lack of global features. Moreover, high-resolution images need more layers to train which means they take more time and computational power to train. Our method also addresses the problem of vanishing gradients as the layers become deeper. In order to address all these issues, we developed a novel image classification architecture, composed of blocks that are designed to learn subtle details from blurred and noisy low-resolution images. Our design of the blocks was heavily influenced by Residual Connections and Inception modules in order to increase performance and reduce parameter sizes. Using the MNIST datasets, we have conducted extensive experiments that show that the introduced architecture is more accurate and faster than other state-of-the-art Convolutional neural networks. Also, as a result of the special characteristics of our model, it can achieve a better result with fewer parameters. </p>
